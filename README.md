# SXI_Core
This contains core functions used by a range of CMEM and SXI projects. 

I've made it because I got fed up of copying the same scripts, and having to fix bugs in lots of copies, or just having keep lots of versions of things the same. 

You would need this module to run any of the following modules: 
CMEM/
CMEM_Image/
CMEM2/
CMEM_Ops/
Emissivity_Cubes/
